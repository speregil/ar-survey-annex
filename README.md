<li><em>AR Technology:</em> The main AR engine used to create the tool.</li>
<li><em>Additional Technologies:</em> Other notable technologies mentioned in the research.</li>
<li><em>Custom Build:</em> If the tool was built from zero, tailored for the research, or if some third-party tool was used or adapted to the needs of the research.</li>
<li><em>Goal Statement:</em> Educational goal guiding the research as stated by the article or inferred by the researchers. The goal was coded in the <verb> + <action> format.</li>
<li><em>Explicit Goal:</em> If the goal was explicitly stated in the research or if the coders had to infer and formulate a goal based on the information provided by the research.</li>
<li><em>Success:</em> If a project could be categorized as a success or not based on the criteria stated in the systematic review, and as best judged by the coders.</li>
<li><em>Comments:</em> Notable comments of the coders about the research.</li>
<li><em>Knowledge Dimension:</em> Classification given by the coders in the knowledge dimension as stated in the systematic review.</li>
<li><em>Cognitive Dimension:</em> Classification given by the coders in the cognitive dimension as stated in the systematic review.</li>
<li><em>Positive Experiences:</em> List of all the coded positive experiences extracted from the research and using the Positive Experiences Code Book.</li>
<li><em>Negative Experiences:</em> List of all the coded negative experiences extracted from the research and using the Negative Experiences Code Book.</li>
</ul>
